## Reflection

This was a challenge provided by Fortune Tech Limited for the Internship at Fortune Tech Limited. Project goals included converting the provided PDF file into a responsive and visually appealing HTML/CSS web page.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React and Bootstrap, and a significant amount of JSX. I chose to use the `npm create vite@latest` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
